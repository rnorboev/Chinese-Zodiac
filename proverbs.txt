Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
It’s no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.
Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.
See a pin and pick it up, all the day you’ll have good luck; see a pin and let it lie, bad luck you’ll have all day.
‘Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.
The old horse in the stable still yearns to run
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
All that glitters is not gold
A monkey in silk is a monkey no less
